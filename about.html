        <h2>About Goodway Sacco Society</h2>
        <p>Our Journey: From Tescom to GoodWay
        Our story begins in 2007 when we were founded as Tescom Society in Kirinyaga County, Kenya. Our initial focus was clear and deeply rooted in the community: to empower private school employees and teachers in the region with reliable savings and credit services.</p>
        <p>As we built trust and demonstrated our commitment, we expanded our support to serve a wider community, including local farmers, business owners, and other institutions. We grew beyond traditional banking, even handling salary and payment processing for various organizations. This period of rapid and meaningful growth was a testament to our solid financial foundation and the trust of our members.</p>
        <p>In 2014, this growth culminated in our rebranding to GoodWay Sacco Society Limited. This name change reflects our broader mission and our evolution into a comprehensive financial partner for our diverse membership. Today, we continue to build on this legacy of trust, offering a secure and supportive path for all our members to achieve their financial goals.</p>
